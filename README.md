# Dungeon Crawler
CPSC 219 Team Project (Group 3)

# About:
A text-based adventure game with randomly generated events and puzzles.
The player is given a series of choices for each event they encounter.
Only with the correct mindset and a bit of luck will you be able to survive the dungeon and move onto the next!

In it's current state, the game is purely console-driven.

# Setup:
The master branch contains the most recent version of the code.

1. Download the master branch
2. Import the code into an IDE as a new Java project
3. Run core/Main.java
