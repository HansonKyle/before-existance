# Dungeon Crawler
CPSC 219 Team Project (Group 3)

# About:
A text-based adventure game with randomly generated events and puzzles.
The player is given a series of choices for each event they encounter.
Only with the correct mindset and a bit of luck will you be able to survive the dungeon and move onto the next!

In the master branch, the game is purely console-driven.
GUI versions are live on branches kyle-2.29

# Setup:
The master branch contains the most recent version of the code.

1. Import the master branch into an IDE as a Java project
3. Run core/Main.java after checkout
